They sailed knowing they might fail, but they knew, like white Freedom Riders did in the American Civil Rights movement, that they might be able to bring attention and action to the plight of Palestinians precisely because their Western world values their lives more than the lives of Palestinians. And whether it\u2019s Greta Thunberg being pulled around by her hair, being forced to kiss the Israeli flag, and being held in inhumane conditions, or Rachel Corrie putting her body in the way of Israeli armored bulldozers to try to save Palestinian homes and getting run over and murdered by that very bulldozer for her bravery and goodness, or every other non-Palestinian that was killed or maimed trying to protect human life, they force people to aka, \u201cif the IDF is doing this to people who have the eyes of the world on them, what unimaginable evils might they be doing to Palestinians in the dark of a media environment where approximately 200 journalists have been killed in just 2 years. \n\nAt this point the situation and facts are clear beyond any reasonable skepticism.
